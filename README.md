# Puzzle Game

A C++ implementation of a puzzle game played in a command line interface.

## Running the program
To run the program, navigate to the project directory in a terminal and run:

- g++ PuzzleGame.cpp -o puzzle
- ./puzzle


## Gameplay
- The player has to rearrange a set of pieces to complete a picture or pattern.
- The player can move pieces up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys.
- The game ends when the picture or pattern is complete.

## Input
- The program takes the size of the puzzle and the initial state of the pieces as input.

## Output
- The program outputs the puzzle after each move, showing the state of the pieces.

## Note
- The program uses ASCII characters to represent the pieces.
- The program does not save the player's progress, so it has to be restarted from the beginning each time it is played.
